Hi team, this is Yana. Just checking in to make sure everything works well on my end.


What is your favorite color? Mine is probably purple.

Hello, I have two favorite colors, black and blood red. Purple is a top pick for me as well.

What is your favorite food to eat?
I like rice, potatoes, pasta, and chicken. There are specific dishes I have in mind. I also like sushi and caesar salad with shrimps (I hate when restaurants replace shrimps with chicken).

What about you?
I like a wide range of food, but tend to like bold flavors. I try to eat more meat and veggies than carbs. Looking at your list I like the same options you selected. Regarding rice, I don't like jasmine rice but love medium and short grain rice. I make sushi at home once a week in the form of nigiri and maki rolls.

Do you have genre for books and movies?

Mat
I love fantasy and sci-fi. I am not a fan of real life shows like the Sopranos despite knowing it is an amazing show.
